  Gatsby is the React way to get into JAM and I think you can guess the tech behind Vuepress

  Both of these are really great choices if you want to build your own blog, site or anything else you might want to build with the JAM Stack! But this comes with its own issue, you have to do the building

  both projects have great documentation and absoultely amazing communities! Gatsby even has $3.8M in funding (whatever it means for an open source project to have funding). If you don't want to build your site from the ground up using Gatsby or Vuepress there are a number of starter projects that are designed to be forked.
