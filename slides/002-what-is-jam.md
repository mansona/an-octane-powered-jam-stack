  So the first thing to figure out is what exactly the term JAM stands for. This quote is taken from jamstack.org so it must be a pretty good definition. It was updated since I last gave a talk on JAM Stack so it's actually way easier to understand! I'll read it out in case you can't see it in the back there

  Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.

  Ok so that's an interesting definition... but why "JAM"!? JAM actually stands for Javascript, APIs and Markup.

  I don't know about you but that doesn't tell me much more about what JAM actually means. Let's dig a bit deeper into the history of the term and see if we can figure out how to define it better
