  So now that you know what you need to do to make the Jammiest of sites in the world, it all sounds pretty simple right? I know that I have been using examples of Ember Addons so far, which does indeed help to simplify the process. But it is still a lot to think about.

  Here in the Ember community we pride ourselves in building shared solutions and there is just that doesn't feel right about saying that our approach to JAM Stack is a todolist that you "just" need to follow to get working. Sure it's amazing that the we can npm install our way to JAM Stack this way but there has to be a more complete solution

  What do I mean by complete solution? well let's take a look at the current big players in the JAM ecosystem
