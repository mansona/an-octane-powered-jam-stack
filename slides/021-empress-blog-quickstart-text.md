  let's take a quick look at the quick start to see how you can get the same blog yourself. this is taken directly from the quickstart on github.

  first thing you do is you create your new ember app, what you see here is just a neat little trick that essentially runs `ember new` even if you don't happen to have ember-cli installed globally. It also makes sure that you run the absolute latest version of ember-cli so you're always up to date!

  next we install two addons, empress-blog and empress-blog-casper-template. This bit is important and I'll come back to it in a bit but for now just remember that there are **two** addons

  now lets see what that does
---

### empress-blog Quickstart

```bash
npm init ember-app super-blog

cd super-blog

# you can replace the template with the one you want to use
npx ember install empress-blog empress-blog-casper-template
```
