  if you run this command (see it's another npm init) then  it  will generate a new template addon for you and setup the development environment so that you can work on your styles without needing to mess with linking your addon into your blog. You just work on the styles and implementation, making the dummy app look how you want and then publish it somewhere

  just running this command gives you the following output

### Create empress-blog Template

```bash
npm init empress-blog-template emberfest

cd empress-blog-emberfest-template
npm start
```
