  So Empress is the JAM Stack project that I have built! Any of you that know me will now that I'm a bit of an Ember nut, and have been since 2011! And you've probably guessed that Empress is Ember's answer to JAM Stack.

  But why does this even exist if Gatsby and Vuepress are so awesome? Well sure it's great that it's in Ember but there is more about it that is unique. The first fundemental difference is that there isn't a single "Empress" that you can install. There are instead a series of different products
