  For any of you that have never seen empress-blog, here is a quick screenshot of the default output that you get when you run the quickstart.

  If you look at this and recognise the default Ghost template then you would be 100% right! You can effectively not tell that the empress-blog-casper template is any different from ghost's template because it is essentially a shallow fork!

  We are able to maintain a shallow fork relatively easily because Ghost use handlebars as their template engine, and all you need to do is get over the slight differences between handlebars and Glimmer templates :wink: I can tell you more about how this works later if you're interested
