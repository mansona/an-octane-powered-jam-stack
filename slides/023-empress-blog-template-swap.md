  having all of the templates and styles in just one addon means that if you want to drastically change the look of your blog all you need to do is remove one addon and add another! pretty cool if you ask me

  right now there are two officall empress-blog templates, the casper template which is a shallow fork of the Ghost Casper template, and there is also the attila template which is again a shallow fork of a popular open source ghost template. As I said before, it's pretty straight forward to port ghost templates to empress-blog templates so if anyone knows a good Ghost template they would like to use don't hesitate to request a port!

  So what happens if you don't want an existing ghost template and you want to start from scratch with your own? well there is an addon for that too!
