  And the main thing is that it is running some sort of Javascript in your browser after it loads the statically generated HTML. And this is one of the reasons why I think that Ember is an amazing choice for building JAM applications, because we've been thinking about this exact lifecycle for a very long time!

  When the JS loads you can have the full interactivity that you expect from a SPA, or one of my favourite benefits is that your subsequent page loads can be instantaneous. Maybe you only download a tiny bit of JSON that represents the next page you clicked and rendering happens in the browser giving lightning fast loading times. Or if you're using something like Ember Data then you might even have the data you need already and the page load can be instantaneous.
