  Now you should all have an idea of the Empress ecosytem, roughly how it works and maybe an idea how you might get started today if you did have a blog that needed writing.

  I said that I wanted to touch on the future of Empress and what the next steps are. I'll be brief so you can all go to the coffee break and top up! remember the table of empress products? <SLIDE>

  the next goal is to move as many of the beta products into Stable, and finish up the Alpha products. one of the main things that is holding up the Beta products is that I need people to try out the products before I release the 1.0 version of them, each of them were built with a specific use-case in mind and I want to make sure that they weren't just "built for me"

  Also not all fo the beta products do the "initial setup" very well, setting up example content etc. there are probably some common functions that could be extracted or some improvements that could be up-streamed into ember-cli so if anyone is interested in helping with that work come find me and let's chat. Lastly I really want one of those template generators for each of the products, currently it only exists for empress-blog, and again there are probably some cominalities that could be extracted once we start making a few of them
