  So now that you know what it looks like, let's go back over the structure. we have 3 things that are working together, an Ember app that I will call our "host" application, this is just a regular ember app with no modifications. and then we have two addons, one core "system" addon and then a template addon.

  The core system addons for an Empress product is essentially the brains of the operation. It does some fun things like generating example content for you and it also contains the build process that converts your markdown into a static api for you. And because of the joys of Ember addons you don't need to do anything at all to wire it up
