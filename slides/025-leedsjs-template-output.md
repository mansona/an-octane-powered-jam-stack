  now it doesn't look very good to start off with :joy: but any Ghost fans might recognise it as the starter template that Ghost came out with in January of last year

  it may not seem like much but it sets up each of your templates and a few css files that you are ready to build a template if you know CSS and HTML, and maybe a tiny bit of Ember template syntax

  And now with Ember Octane, these templates are significantly closer to HTML! I have even heard Ember referred to as a HTML-First framework now that Octane is finally released!
