  now it doesn't look very good to start off with :joy: but any Ghost fans might recognise it as the starter template that Ghost came out with in January of this year (or last year maybe, I can't quite remember)

  it may not seem like much but it sets up each of your templates and a few css files that you are ready to build a template if you know CSS and HTML, and maybe a tiny bit of Ember template syntax
