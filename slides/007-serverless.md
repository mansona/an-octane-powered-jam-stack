  Who here knows Netlify?

  So for any of you who don't know who Netlify is, if you simplify a few things, Netlify are essentially a CDN and focus on serving **static** assets quickly all over the world. Part of what makes JAM applications "jammie" is the idea of not having servers... which plays quite well for a company that specialises in servings statically over a CDN.

  Slight caveat: in the same way that the serverless movement with lambda doesn't actually get rid of the server alltogether, there are still servers running the CDN. Serverless hosting is more of a logical distinction than a statement of fact. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming!

  At this point you probably think I'm a sinic about the whole thing, in fact it's quite the opposite! I'm in love with JAM Stack and I am a big fan of Netlify

  The reason I'm saying all this stuff about it being "mostly marketing" is to illustrate that JAM Stack is not something REVOLUTIONARY but instead it is an evolution of what we already know that has just been named with a catchy name, so we can all talk about it a bit easier.

  Thinking of it like this is also useful to help us categorise what is or isn't a JAM application and it also helps to demistify the term (at least it does for me)

  Now with all this history in our back pockets, we can move on to my patent pending JAM Stack Classification spectrum
