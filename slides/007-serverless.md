  Netlify are essentially a CDN and JAM Stack is like the serverless of the frontend world. CDNs are only able to serve static assets (not strictly true but it's a simpler definition for now)

  You probably think that I'm a synic at this stage but don't get me wrong. I am in love with the JAM stack, I even wrote a whole JAM focued open source project and don't forget that I even flew over here just to talk to you lovely people about it.

  The reason I'm saying all this stuff about it being a maketing term is to show you that it is not something REVOLUTIONARY but instead it is an evolution of what we already know. Personally I like that because it helps me anchor my thinking about JAMStack and makes it a bit more accessible.

  Now let's dive in and say what JAM actually is!
