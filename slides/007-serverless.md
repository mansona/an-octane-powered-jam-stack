  Who here knows Netlify?

  So for any of you who don't know who Netlify is, they are essentially a CDN company and focus on serving **static** assets quickly all over the world. Part of what makes JAM applications "jammie" is the idea of not having servers, or not maintinging a server yourself (as we heard in the definition) which plays quite well for a company that specialises in CDN hosting!

  Slight caveat: If you hear people saying that JAM sites are like the "serverless of frontend development" in the same way that the whole serverless movement with lambda etc. doesn't actually get rid of the server all together, there are still servers running the CDN, it's just that you don't have to manage them!

  You might think that think I'm a cynic about the whole thing, in fact I'm quite the opposite! I'm in love with JAM Stack and I am a big fan of Netlify

  The reason I'm saying all this stuff about it being "mostly marketing" is to illustrate that JAM Stack is not something REVOLUTIONARY but instead it is an evolution of what we already know and it's just been given a catchy name, so we can all talk about it a bit easier.

  Thinking of it like this is also useful to help us categorise what is or isn't a JAM application and it also helps to demystify the term (at least it does for me)

  Now with all this history in our back pockets, we can move on to my patent pending JAM Stack Classification spectrum
