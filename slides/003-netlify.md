  JAM Stack is a marketing phrase 100% created by Netlify. How many people here knew that? And you know what, that doesn't even make me mad at all, all I can think is

  Respect Netlify. Inventing a term and getting everyone to talk about it as much as JAM Stack is not easy and they have done a fantastic job

  But why would Netlify be the ones to coin this term it in the first place? It's back to that bit in the definition I read out: "serving sites directly from a CDN"
