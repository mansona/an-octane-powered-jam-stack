  so we can earn our cool JAM badge

  since I've been talking for 10 mins already let's go straight for the big one

  who here knows SSR? has anyone gotten it to work for them? in production?

  a lot of you might know SSR as setting up a node server, pushing a whole load of buttons and leavers to get a React app working on the server.

  don't forget that netlify is primarly a static asset CDN, so settin up an express server isn't very jammy. Sure you could get it working on their serverless functions to make it a little jammier but if you're going for max jam you should go for pre-rendering.
