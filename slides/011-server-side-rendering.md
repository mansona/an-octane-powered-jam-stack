  who here knows SSR? has anyone gotten it to work for them? in production?

  a lot of you might know SSR as setting up a node server, pushing a whole load of buttons and leavers to get a React app working on the server.

  don't forget that netlify is primarly a static asset CDN, so settin up an express server isn't very jammy. Sure you could get it working on their serverless functions to make it a little jammier but if you're going for max jam you should go for pre-rendering.
