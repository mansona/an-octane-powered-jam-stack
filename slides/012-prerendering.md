  With a massive thanks to Ed Falkner, we have an amazing Ember addon called Prember! With very little effort you can get setup pre-rendering your Ember application, run through all your known urls of your app, save all that juicy HTML output and serve it statically on something like netlify.

  it is probably worth mentioning that I'm not getting paid by netifly and other static hosting providers are available :joy:

  And thanks to Ed, we are getting closer to earning our JAM making scouts badge! SLIDE

  If you are thinking this just sounds like a static site generator, in the likes of jeckle or middleman, then I would have to agree! Everything that I have said so far could have been done with one of those other tools, and it is not the fact that we are using Javascript when generating static HTML that makes the system more jammie (as in the J in JAM), there is one key thing that makes this modern JAM architecture different:
