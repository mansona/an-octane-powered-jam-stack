  TODO: talk about gastby and vuepress as low level building blocks, how you need to build the thing with them

  Gatsby is the React way to get into JAM and I think you can guess the tech behind Vuepress

  Both of these are really great choices if you want to build your own blog, site or anything else you might want to build with the JAM Stack! But this comes with its own issue, you have to do the building

  both projects have great documentation and absoultely amazing communities! Gatsby even has $3.8M in funding (whatever it means for an open source project to have funding). If you don't want to build your site from the ground up using Gatsby or Vuepress there are a number of starter projects that are designed to be forked.

  Here you can see the gatsby starters page, I couldn't find a good list of vuepress starters so I'm just showing gatsby. So you can go to this site, chose one you like fork it and get going.

  But did you notice this little number up top? there are over 250 starters you can chose from!!!! All of them are reasonably unique but subtly different

  This is where I want to start talking about my project and get into the meat of "JAM for humans"

  So Empress is the JAM Stack project that I have built! Any of you that know me will now that I'm a bit of an Ember nut, and have been since 2011! And you've probably guessed that Empress is Ember's answer to JAM Stack.

  But why does this even exist if Gatsby and Vuepress are so awesome? Well sure it's great that it's in Ember but there is more about it that is unique. The first fundemental difference is that there isn't a single "Empress" that you can install. There are instead a series of different products
