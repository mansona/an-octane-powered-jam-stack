  Each one fo these "products" try to do one thing and do it well. I've split them into Stable, Beta and Alpha based on how ready each of them are for you to get started with them today, I'll go into what that means a little bit more in a second.

  Let's go through some of the top ones really quickly just to give you an idea of what it does. As you can imagine the first one is a blog. empress-blog is probably the flagship Empress product that started this whole process of thinking different "products". Who here knows what Guidemaker is? Guidemaker is essentially the tech that is currently powering the Ember guides! If you wanted to build a guides website for yourself you can go to the repo now, follow the readme and boom you're ready to go! Each of these repos are under the empress github org by the way if you are looking for them.

  One of my favourite "products" is field-guide, which is a styleguide or "design system" product that was instrumental in the new Ember Website redesign process. It essentially gives you an easy way to document your styleguide while guaranteeing that there won't be any CSS bleed between field-guide and your actual styleguide.

  The last one I'll mention is open-slide, which happens to be what is powering this exact presentation! It's quite functional and it's in the Beta column because it's a little bit under-documented and the only templates I have so far are based on revealjs, which are a bit clunky.

  as you can see each of these things have very different focuses, and that laser focus of each product makes them a dream to work with!

  Now that you have a bit of an overview, I'll use empress-blog to detail more about how it all works
