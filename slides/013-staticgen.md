  I don't know how many of you are familiar with staticgen.com but it has a list of all the static site generators out there. This list alone has 260 (but it seems way larger when you scroll :joy:)

  let's limit that to only js, bringing us down to 98. and then let's limit that down to projects with deploy to netlify buttons. that brings us to 24

  Ok so this is mainly a troll. Firsly the J in JAM doesn't mean that the static building part needs to be done in Javascript. The 3rd most popular static gen website is Hugo which is written in Go and even has a deploy to netlify button.

  The J in JAM is more about client-side JS and goes back to my whole thign about SPAs
