  Who here is working on a single page app in production? or even a side project? The reason I'm asking about SPA is because if you have ever written one then you're already using JAM principles. This doesn't mean that every SPA is 100% JAM filled, but there are some things that you can do to your SPA to make it more Jammie.

  We'll go through a few things and show you how to move up the JAM continuoum.
