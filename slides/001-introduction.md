  Hi Everyone! My name is Chris, this is me with my trusty sidekick Rodney. I'm a developer at simplabs, which as you're all in Europe and at an Ember conference you will have heard about us.

  I'm here today to talk to you about JAM Stack, give you a bit of history of what it is, where the term came from. I'll then go into some details about where Ember sits in the JAM ecosystem, what you can do with it today and some exciting tools to get started quickly. Then I will touch on the future of JAM in the Ember ecosystem and how you might get involved if you are interested.

  So let's get started!
