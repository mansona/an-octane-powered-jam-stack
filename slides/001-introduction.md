  Hi Everyone! My name is Chris, and this is me with my trusty sidekick Rodney. I'm a developer at simplabs, which as you're all at a European Ember conference you will probably have heard about us. You may have also noticed a booth outside so if you don't know who we are then come chat to us and find out more, and I'm always accessible on twitter via @real_ate.

  I'm here today to talk to you about the JAM Stack. I'll start off giving you a bit of history of what JAM Stack actually is and where the term came from. I'll then go into some details about Ember's position in the JAM Stack revolution, hopefully giving you a clear idea what you can do with Ember today and introduce you to some exciting tools to get started quickly. Then I will touch very briefly on the future of JAM in the Ember ecosystem and how you might get involved if you are interested.

  So let's get started!

  Oh and by the way, I am going to say JAM a **lot** in this talk. If you tweet me your estimate of how many times I end up saying JAM I'll promise to send the person with the closest guess a cool bit of swag!

  So now let's really get started
