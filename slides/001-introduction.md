  Hi Everyone! My name is Chris and I'm here to talk to you about JAM stack.

  If you don't know me already: I'm a developer at simplabs, and I think I'm relelatively frieldy so if you see me hanging around outside at the simplabs booth feel free to come up and chat about anything! If you're less of a face-to-face kinda person, I'm always accessible on twitter via @real_ate.

  So I said I'm here to talk about the JAM stack, A good place to start is to give you a bit of history of what JAM Stack actually is and where the term came from. I'll then go into some details about Ember's position in the JAM Stack revolution, and why Ember Octane could be a significant Unique Selling Point for us. I'll also show you a few projects that will allow you to get kick-started really quickly and then i'll touch very briefly on the future of JAM in the Ember ecosystem and how you might get involved if you are interested.

  So let's get started!

  Oh and by the way, I am going to say JAM a **lot** in this talk. If you tweet me your estimate of how many times I end up saying JAM I promise to send the person with the closest guess a cool bit of swag!

  So now let's really get started
